# Is the committed tree what the generator actually produces?
#
# BOTH FAILURE MODES THIS CATCHES ARE SILENT. Nothing breaks when generated
# output drifts from the model, so nothing reports it:
#
#   - STALE OUTPUT. Regeneration never DELETES a file it has stopped
#     emitting. Narrow the model's secrets plugin selection, drop a target,
#     rename an entity - the superseded files stay in the tree. Seen in one
#     SDK as seven orphaned provider clients in scala and seven in zig: the
#     scala ones surfaced only because one test cross-checks the tree
#     against the model, and zig's were caught by nothing at all.
#
#   - MODEL DRIFT. The committed .sdk/model/sdk.json can go round a loop,
#     gaining and losing the name case variants and main.api / main.custom
#     depending on which command last wrote it. `voxgig-model --no-config`
#     writes a REDUCED model - it skips the .model-config build that
#     registers the apidef and sdkgen actions, so neither runs, and sdk.json
#     is still written without what they contribute. The only symptom is a
#     dirty tree after regenerating, which is easy to commit past. To
#     inspect a model with no side effects: `npm run dry-generate`.
#
# THE TARGET TREES ARE DELETED FIRST, and that is the whole point. A plain
# regeneration cannot find stale output: the file is committed, generation
# leaves it alone, and `git status` is silent. Only forcing the generator to
# reproduce the tree from nothing shows what it no longer emits.
#
# This DETECTS, it does not prevent. Run it before a release, or after
# changing the model or the toolchain.
#
# Not wired into CI on purpose: it regenerates every target, which is
# minutes of work and needs the .sdk dependencies installed - too heavy for
# a per-push job, and it would only tell CI what one command finds here.
